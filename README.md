Simple Remake of Snake Game in C++ with Raylib

# mini docs
If you want to play my game just follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the [raylib.com](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) website and download this fantastic library.

2. Go back to this repository and use the following command:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AntonioBerna/snake-ray
    ```

3. Then access the directory with the `cd snake-ray/` command and use the `./build.sh` command to build the executable.

    >**NOTE:** If the `./build.sh` command does not work you can try changing the permissions of that file with the `chmod +x build.sh` command or you can use the `sh build.sh` command.

4. Finally use the command `./snake` to start playing, have fun!
